                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Ethan Frazier, I'm a pretty funny guy and I'm very nice as well, so if you see me in
                    public and want to get an autograph because of my awesome game, I'd be happy to do it. On my free
                    time I like going outside and watch movies, and even make some skits myself, but at times I play
                    video games as well, and that's what got me into making this game, Get To School 5. It's the 5th one
                    because I'm picking up after the other students. This time, the guy will actually get to school.
                    I chose to do York Tech because I was really into the computer stuff because my Dad is an IT manager
                    as well, and ever since I got my first computer when I was little, I became very inerested on how
                    the computers worked and stuff. I started out liking the game development and coding stuff, I even
                    made a few very bad shooter games myself on Unreal Engine but they are lost because I deleted them.
                    But when the time was getting near for me to join this school, I started getting into the hardware
                    side of things and troubleshooting, and that was the thing I was the most good at. So then, I joined
                    this school with the knowledge of how to turn on a computer and hopefully leaving with the knowledge
                    on how to build a computer on my own. Hope you enjoyed my backstory, and now enjoy my game.
