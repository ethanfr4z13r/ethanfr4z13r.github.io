                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Ethan Frazier, I'm a pretty funny guy and I'm very nice as well, so if you see me in
                    public and want to get an autograph because of my awesome game, I'd be happy to do it. On my free
                    time I like going outside and watch movies, and even make some skits myself, but at times I play
                    video games as well, and that's what got me into making this game, Get To School 5. It's the 5th one
                    because I'm picking up after the other students. This time, the guy will actually get to school.
                    Hope you enjoyed my backstory, and now enjoy my game.
