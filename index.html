                <p>Get To School is the best Indie game ever created and is appreciated around the world for it's very
                    creative design choices and made in a unique game engine. One day you wake up and you realise, you
                    are very late for school. You are on thin ice for being late and if you are late one more time,
                    you'll get suspended! So you have to go on an adventure to Get To School, but you fight strange
                    stuff and make friends along the way. Click the image on the left to see screenshots and play the game!
